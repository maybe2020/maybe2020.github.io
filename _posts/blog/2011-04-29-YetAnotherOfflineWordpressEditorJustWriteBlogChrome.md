It's really a long time that I was using WLW and ScribeFire (They are all great offline editor for wordpress! Thanks!), but recently, I am tired to use such 'heavy' tool to just post some very simple or mainly-composed-by text posts. Even ScribeFire is more and more 'full-function', and too many UI widgets take too much screen scale (buttons, pull-down selectors, and etc.).

You know, for blogers like me, sometimes can only have 1 eeepc with poor 10' screen, such 'full-feature' editors are too luxury for me. Just image it, I must write my long words into 50%~20% or even 10% height textarea of screen with all other part occupied by all kinds of post info input fields. What I need is a tool can fully focus on the 'writing' itself. So....

  * Almost fullscreen scale for writing field;
  * Info input can be hided;
  * more elegant UI (at least for myself);
  * cross all OS;
  * Multiple sites supporting;
  * Auto saving;
  * blablabla...

OK, it's a very natural thought to make it a chrome app this times. So I started, and after around 4 weeks, such tool named 'justwriteblog', which can support wordpress/metaWeblog offline writing, is ready.

Several great jQuery plugins are used in this app, I feel it's so convenient for developer to make a chrome extension/app by leverage all kinds of web design resource in the internet, so , to say Google maybe really find a excellent way for the future:)

Don't speak too much on it, just try it, since it's of couse totally free: [APP Address](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghpmcddkdeedmnceoadodjebomomdfho), and, give me 5 stars if you like it....just if..
