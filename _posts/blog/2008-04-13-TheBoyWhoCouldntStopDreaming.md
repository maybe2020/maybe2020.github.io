Jesus, Walk with Me   
  
When I wake up in the morning   
feel the sun shine on my face   
I get up and I’m yawning   
There is so much time I can waste   
  
Cause I need this   
God feed me with your love   
And take me through the day   
  
Fool me into believing   
I don’t care if your deceiving me   
I wouldn’t want it any other way   
‘Cause then I’d only stay the same   
  
Fool me into believing   
I don’t care if your deceiving me   
  
When I wake up in the dawning   
And the day is not far away   
Find my way in a dark room   
That my eyes fail to see through   
  
If God made me   
Will Jesus save me?   
And take me through the day   
  
Fool me into believing   
I don’t care if your deceiving me   
I wouldn’t want it any other way   
‘Cause then I’d only stay the same   
  
Fool me into believing   
I don’t care if your deceiving me   
Before I go I need to be   
Something more than the skin and bones you see   
  
‘Cause everywhere I go   
Everywhere I’ve been   
And everywhere I’m going to   
I only go with you  
  
深夜电话响起，虽然没有接，却也是从梦里醒来了，梦里都是工作上的事情，却忘了睡下时是黄昏，手里捧着几个小时后就要考试的英美文学。赶紧关掉电脑里吟唱的《I Cry》，情歌总是那么的伤人，特别在这寂静的夜里。为了学习而醒着是件幸福的事情，我是说相对于工作、感情、身体之类的事情，不喜欢夜里醒着，喜欢每天都陪着太阳，睡着，醒来……
